This session will cover the basics of deep learning, including its history, important concepts, and applications. We will review model architectures and parameters, including the loss function and optimizer. We will also cover training regimes and the basics of gradient descent and backpropagation.

Auto Insurance in Sweden Many people dream of being one of them, but only few make it all the way to the top. According to two CBS researchers, it takes more than just hard work to get to the top of the Danish hierarchy of power. read more
In this project we are going to construct and explore a network of Danish power elites derived from boards of various organisations in th country.</description></item><item><title>Group assignment 1</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m4/01_intro-to-deep-learning/4_group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m4/01_intro-to-deep-learning/4_group_assignment/</guid><description>Using a dataset of your choice from the first semester, build and train an ANN.
