This session will cover the basics of deep learning, including its history, important concepts, and applications. We will review model architectures and parameters, including the loss function and optimizer. We will also cover training regimes and the basics of gradient descent and backpropagation.

Data: The data is to be found at: https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/tree/master/00_data/network_krackhard (Hint: You neet to download the raw data) Data: What do I get? Background Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks.</description></item><item><title>NW Cases</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m4/01_intro-to-deep-learning/3_exercise_ann_pytorch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m4/01_intro-to-deep-learning/3_exercise_ann_pytorch/</guid><description>Danish Power Elites Many people dream of being one of them, but only few make it all the way to the top. According to two CBS researchers, it takes more than just hard work to get to the top of the Danish hierarchy of power. read more
In this project we are going to construct and explore a network of Danish power elites derived from boards of various organisations in th country.</description></item></channel></rss>
