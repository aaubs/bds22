What makes them particularly exciting for businesses and social science applications is their ability to enable more intuitive, meaningful language-based search, content deduplication, and clustering. With Sentence Transformers, businesses can enhance the accuracy of their search engines, provide more accurate recommendations, and reduce redundancy in content databases.</description></item></channel></rss>
