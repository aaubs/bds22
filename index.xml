For some, this will be &amp;ldquo;old news&amp;rdquo;, but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. We start with a general theory lecture on data structures and properties, and then dive into Python specific applications of statistical programming.

Roman x Stable Diffusion
In this session we will be trying out some of the techniques already learned on real world data from AirBnb as well as experiment with Kaggle
Part 1: AirBnb In this notebook we will be using data from AirBnb for some basic EDA and geoplotting
EDA and Geoviz starter EDA and Geoviz class Part 2: Kaggle In this notebook we will be learning how to work with data from Kaggle as well as exercise more simple data-viz.</description></item><item><title>Modules</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/info/02_modules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/info/02_modules/</guid><description>For Business Data Science Students M1: Data Handling, Exploration &amp;amp; Applied Machine Learning 10 ECTS
This module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.
M2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing 5 ECTS
Focuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.</description></item><item><title>EDA workshop &amp; Working with JSON/APIs/MongoDB</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m1/01_basics/04-eda-open-policing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m1/01_basics/04-eda-open-policing/</guid><description>In this workshop we are going to explore 2 things. More advanced EDA as well as working with internet data.
EDA - Open Policing Project In this workshop we are going to work with the Open Policing Dataset. Below you will find the starter notebook where this dataset (Rhode Island) is explored. You can check out some of the research based on this data ont the project’s page.

We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.
Main Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using Python.</description></item><item><title>Semester Schedule</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/info/03_schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/info/03_schedule/</guid><description>This will be shortly updated with additional key dates and topics for the semester.
