Welcome to this Exercise session on using TinyDB and SQLite, two lightweight databases that are ideal for small-scale applications and development tasks. While TinyDB is a document-oriented database that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use with JSON-like structures, SQLite is a popular and lightweight SQL-based relational database management system.

Throughout this tutorial, we will explore the following topics:

- Loading a CSV file into both TinyDB and SQLite
- Performing basic operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, in both databases

We will be using Python along with the TinyDB and SQLite libraries to accomplish these tasks. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts and operations in both TinyDB and SQLite. Additionally, we will provide a hands-on exercise using Google Colab to help you practice and reinforce the skills you have learned.
