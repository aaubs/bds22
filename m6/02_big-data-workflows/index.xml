This can pose a significant challenge for traditional data processing tools and techniques. Fortunately, there are a variety of Big Data processing engines available today that are designed to handle these challenges, such as Apache Spark and Polars. Spark is a powerful Big Data processing engine that allows you to work with large datasets in ML projects.</description></item><item><title>RNNs and LSTMs</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/02_big-data-workflows/2_exercise_bigdata_workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/02_big-data-workflows/2_exercise_bigdata_workflow/</guid><description>In this session, we will introduce students to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. We will discuss the basics of RNNs and LSTMs, how they differ from other neural network architectures, and how they can be applied to business problems.
