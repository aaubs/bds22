The app is built using the FastAPI framework and Spacy library. The main functionality of the app is to take user text input, identify entities in the text using Spacy&amp;rsquo;s pre-trained model, and then return the same text with the identified entities replaced by &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo;. The app includes a simple &amp;lsquo;get&amp;rsquo; route that returns a message to confirm that the server is running.</description></item></channel></rss>
