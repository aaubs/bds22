It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging and sharing code, and deploying models.
MLflow provides a unified platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to deployment. It helps to increase productivity, collaboration, and reproducibility in data science projects.
Here are the main components of MLflow:
Experiment Tracking: This component helps you to track your machine learning experiments by recording and visualizing metrics, parameters, and artifacts.</description></item></channel></rss>
