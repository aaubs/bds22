It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging and sharing code, and deploying models.
MLflow provides a unified platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to deployment. It helps to increase productivity, collaboration, and reproducibility in data science projects.
Here are the main components of MLflow:
Experiment Tracking: This component helps you to track your machine learning experiments by recording and visualizing metrics, parameters, and artifacts.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 2: Performing a Big Data workflow with Spark and Polars</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/03_mlops-with-mlflow/2_exercise_bigdata_workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/03_mlops-with-mlflow/2_exercise_bigdata_workflow/</guid><description>In this session, we will demonstrate how to use Apache Spark, a powerful Big Data processing engine, for processing large datasets in ML projects. The session will cover tasks such as setting up a Spark environment, reading and writing data, and performing transformations and aggregations on data. Additionally, we will also introduce Polars, a similar data manipulation library for Rust, and compare its features to those of Spark.
This session will provide hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding and skills in working with Spark and Polars for processing big data in ML projects.</description></item><item><title>Group assignment 2</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/03_mlops-with-mlflow/3_group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/03_mlops-with-mlflow/3_group_assignment/</guid><description>Portfolio Exercise 2: Introduction Welcome to the Apache Spark or Polars Group assignment! For this assignment, you will be using your previous project as the dataset (or other large datasets of your choice) to process EDA part using Apache Spark or Polars. The goal of this assignment is to help you gain hands-on experience in processing and analyzing big data using Apache Spark or Polars. You will learn how to load and manipulate data with Spark or Polars and perform various transformations and actions on the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
