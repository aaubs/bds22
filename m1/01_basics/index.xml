For some, this will be &amp;ldquo;old news&amp;rdquo;, but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. We start with a general theory lecture on data structures and properties, and then dive into Python specific applications of statistical programming.

Roman x Stable Diffusion
In this session we will be trying out some of the techniques already learned on real world data from AirBnb as well as experiment with Kaggle
Part 1: AirBnb In this notebook we will be using data from AirBnb for some basic EDA and geoplotting
EDA and Geoviz starter EDA and Geoviz class Part 2: Kaggle In this notebook we will be learning how to work with data from Kaggle as well as exercise more simple data-viz.</description></item><item><title>EDA workshop &amp; Working with JSON/APIs/MongoDB</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m1/01_basics/04-eda-open-policing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m1/01_basics/04-eda-open-policing/</guid><description>In this workshop we are going to explore 2 things. More advanced EDA as well as working with internet data.
EDA - Open Policing Project In this workshop we are going to work with the Open Policing Dataset. Below you will find the starter notebook where this dataset (Rhode Island) is explored. You can check out some of the research based on this data ont the project’s page.

Roman x Stable Diffusion
In this hackathon, you will be using everything you have learned so far (and some things still coming up next week) to create a striking and informative dashboard. The winning group will receive an even more amazing prize!
What to do? In groups, find an exciting dataset of similar complexity as the ones we worked with in class (e.</description></item></channel></rss>
